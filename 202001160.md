Q2)
Scope:
A significant portion of people have some sort of hearing impairment. The suggested application meets the unique requirements of its consumers. Using their Android devices, users of this software can identify various sounds in their immediate environment. When it detects these specified sounds, such as automobile horns or alarms, it monitors the area in real time and notifies the user via haptic feedback. The application enables users to keep aware of their surroundings while also staying secure and awake.

Features:

1) Low Latency monitoring in real time.

2)utilising artificial intelligence to monitor.

3)function for haptic alert

4)large sound library with preset noises.

5)customizable sound addition and removal.

6)An application should always be operating in the background.

Non-Functional Requirment:
1)Availability and Usability a. Android users should have no trouble downloading the application. b. The application's user interface needs to be straightforward and interactive.

2)Performance a. The programme must be able to quickly process the noises in real time. b. The user should receive alerts with virtually little latency.

3)Reliability The programme must be able to operate continually in the background. b. Accurate identification of the sounds is necessary. c. The user should be informed in the event that the application fails.

4)Maintainability a. It should not be permitted for some necessary noises, such as car horns and fire sirens, to be eliminated from the list of recognised sounds. b. A reset button should be available to bring back the preset sound library.
